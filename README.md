# Linux & Shell Scripting Final Project
Final project for the 'Hands-on Introduction to Linux Commands and Shell Scripting' course from IBM. The course is part of the IBM DevOps and Software Engineer Professional Certificate.

For the final project I have been tasked with creating a shell script which runs everyday and automatically backs any encrypted password files that have been updated in the past 24 hours.

A template was provided which can be downloaded at the following link https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-LX0117EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Final%20Project/backup.sh
